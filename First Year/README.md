## First Year (1)

This directory contains the different project i made during my first year at Epitech Paris.

You can do the project in any order but they are logicaly to be done in the order listed below.

Every projects have a given solution, I don't pretend to give the best and I encourage you to do it your own way. (unless you are really stuck)
